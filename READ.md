# Code D'oeuvre: API
Sample of the coding excersie done for Boca Code API course.

## Note
***api > server.js***

Feel free to change this to index.js. If you do so, make sure to update package.json > main > index.js.
I choose server.js as it makes sense to me. 

***nodemon***
If using server.js you might have to launch nodemon by the following
```
nodemon server.js
```
That being said, updating package.json to server.js, I've been able to simply launch it by typing `nodemon`
